Let's start with definitions

A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little abstraction from a computer's instruction set. Example: Assembly language. In contrast to them we have a high-level language, that enables to write programs that are more or less independent of a particular type of computer. Such languages are considered high-level because they are closer to human languages.

In the beginning of computer era the developers had only low-level programming languages. They used them for all the stuff they can. It was really hard, because you had to know the architecture of the target machine very well. Moreover, at that time every new machine had implicit features, so, if the new machine is released, you need to write all the programs from the scratch. 
In the end, programmer decide that they don't it anymore "Stop endure it", so they created a high-level programming languages, that unlikely their predecessors used a code-oriented paradigm. 

HLL have many advantages in comparison with LLL: they are easier to learn, read, understand, hence support an abstraction. Therefore we don't guess about target system features, we just write a code and it increases development speed. So, we can say, that they specialize. Some of them are using for front-end primarily, some for back-end, some of them have no precise purpose. That has affected the developers. Nowadays, they don't need to know all the fields of IT, only their own specialization field. 

There are some structural differences between two types of programming languages: the code of LLL is just translated into machine code. But the HLL use special programs called compilers and interpreters. Their main goal is to translate source HL code to LL target code. They just do it it in different ways. Compiler creates an executable file and then program runs system executes commands inside it. An interpreter reads the source program line by line and executes it directly. It leads to less performance but greater convenience and speed of development 

The transition from lll to hll was a revolution not only in the industry. This has affected all areas of society. And we can see it with our own eyes.

I guess we should say smth like this: There are some structural diffs: blah-blah. And some functional: blah.
Cause there's a mess in argumentation
